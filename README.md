ETCH-A-SKETCH

This is my interpretation of the Etch-a-sketch project that is part of the Odin Project.

How It's Made:
Tech Used: HTML, Javascript, CSS
A grid of divs is dynamically made by using loops in Javascript. These divs are then given event listeners so that they can be recoloured when the user hovers their mouse over it.

Lessons Learned:
This project has given me a much stronger understanding of the Document Object Model and how elements can be manipulates using Javascript.
